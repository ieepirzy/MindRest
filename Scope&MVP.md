### **Why This Approach?**
Launching an MVP will allow us to:

- Get the project out there to invite potential collaborators.

This approach ensures that Mindrest will be useful and meaningful even in its early stages. Over the coming months, we will continue to add new features based on user feedback, industry trends, and user needs.
