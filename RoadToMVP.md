### **Phase 1: Conceptualization & Planning (1–2 Weeks)**
- **Market Research:**
  - Analyze existing wellness apps, noting their strengths and gaps.
  - Define unique value propositions for Mindrest.
- **Feature Prioritization:**
  - List features for the MVP and future updates (based on earlier discussion).
  - Define core features needed for the MVP: simple journaling, mood tracking, and mindfulness tips.
- **Tech Stack Selection:**
  - Finalize technologies for mobile development (Flutter or React Native).
  - Choose AI model integration (e.g., OpenAI API, DeepSeek API).
  - Decide on the data storage system (local storage vs cloud).
  - Plan for encryption and privacy measures.
- **Project Management Tools:**
  - Set up a (Software TBD) to track tasks and deadlines.
  - Break down large tasks into manageable chunks.
  
### **Phase 2: Initial Development & Prototyping (3–4 Weeks)**
- **Wireframing & Design:**
  - Create basic wireframes for user flows and app screens.
  - Focus on a minimal, user-friendly design with age-appropriate elements.
- **App Architecture:**
  - Set up app skeleton: basic UI structure, navigation, and core layout.
  - Define user data models for journaling, mood tracking, and mindfulness.
- **First AI Integration:**
  - Integrate a simple AI model for generating journaling prompts based on user mood.
  - Test AI behavior for consistency and relevance.
- **Basic Mood Logging:**
  - Implement a basic mood tracking system.
  - Allow users to log their mood at various times (manually or prompted).
- **Testing & Debugging:**
  - Conduct basic functionality tests for app layout, AI responses, and mood logging.

### **Phase 3: User Testing & Iteration (2–3 Weeks)**
- **Alpha Testing:**
  - Select a small group of testers to try out the app.
  - Collect feedback on app functionality, UX/UI, and overall experience.
- **Feedback Integration:**
  - Analyze feedback and adjust app features accordingly.
  - Resolve any bugs or issues found during testing.
  - Iterate on journaling prompts to ensure they are meaningful and helpful.
  
### **Phase 4: Refining MVP & Final Prep (2–3 Weeks)**
- **Feature Lockdown:**
  - Finalize the MVP feature list and ensure no additional features are added.
  - Double down on the core functionality: journaling prompts, mood tracking, mindfulness suggestions.
- **Polishing UI:**
  - Make small design improvements for a polished and cohesive look.
  - Ensure the app is intuitive, especially for first-time users.
- **Security & Privacy Review:**
  - Ensure data encryption (AES-256) and local storage options are implemented.
  - Review data handling and ensure compliance with privacy standards.
- **Beta Testing:**
  - Open the app for a wider group of beta testers (a larger group than the alpha).
  - Collect final rounds of feedback and make adjustments.
  
### **Phase 5: Launch Prep (1 Week)**
- **App Store Preparation:**
  - Finalize app metadata, screenshots, and descriptions for the App Store and Google Play Store.
  - Set up a simple landing page or website to introduce Mindrest.
- **Final Testing:**
  - Perform end-to-end testing on the app to catch any last-minute issues.
- **Marketing & Launch Strategy:**
  - Create a basic marketing strategy (targeted at initial users).
  - Set up social media accounts (Twitter, YouTube, etc.) for visibility.
  - Promote the app in relevant online communities (Reddit, Twitter, etc.) to build anticipation.
  
### **Phase 6: MVP Launch**
- **Launch Date:** *Target End of Summer 2025* (TBD)
  - Release the app on mobile stores (Google Play & Apple App Store).
  - Monitor user feedback and make any necessary quick bug fixes.
  - Keep marketing efforts alive to attract early adopters.
