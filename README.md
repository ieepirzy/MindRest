# 🧘‍♂️ Mindrest — Mental Wellness, One Thought at a Time
>A gentle companion for self-awareness, emotional clarity, and inner balance.

## 💡 What is Mindrest?
Mindrest is a mobile-first wellness companion that guides users through their emotional landscape using reflective prompts, AI-assisted journaling, and personalized mindfulness suggestions.
>It’s not about mood tracking. It’s about understanding the self — through thoughts, not just numbers.

✨ Core Features (Planned)

📓 Guided Journaling — AI-enhanced prompts to help articulate emotions.\
🌤️ Mood Mapping — contextual mood logging with pattern recognition.\
🧘 Personalized Mindfulness — gentle nudges toward breathing, breaks, or reflection.\
🧠 Cognitive Insights — surface thinking patterns, biases, or recurring concerns.\
>I have found through personal usage that AI is powerful in picking up patterns we might otherwise miss!

🔐 Private by Design — all logs stored locally or end-to-end encrypted.
>What could be more private, than our very thoughts?
