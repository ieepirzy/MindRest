# 🧘‍♂️ Mindrest — Mental Wellness, One Thought at a Time
>A gentle companion for self-awareness, emotional clarity, and inner balance.

## 💡 What is Mindrest?
Mindrest is a mobile-first wellness companion that guides users through their emotional landscape using reflective prompts, AI-assisted journaling, and personalized mindfulness suggestions.
>It’s not about mood tracking. It’s about understanding the self — through thoughts, not just numbers.

✨ Core Features (Planned)

📓 Guided Journaling — AI-enhanced prompts to help articulate emotions.\
🌤️ Mood Mapping — contextual mood logging with pattern recognition.\
🧘 Personalized Mindfulness — gentle nudges toward breathing, breaks, or reflection.\
🧠 Cognitive Insights — surface thinking patterns, biases, or recurring concerns.\
>I have found through personal usage that AI is powerful in picking up patterns we might otherwise miss!

🔐 Private by Design — all logs stored locally or end-to-end encrypted.
>What could be more private, than our very thoughts?


#### Specifics still subject to change.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Age-Sensitive Versions
Mindrest is designed with emotional maturity and cognitive development in mind. We plan to offer curated versions of the app for different age groups:

Mindrest Junior For ages 6–11. Simple prompts, fun visuals, and gamified mindfulness. 
> Designed with an ability for parents to see a summary of their childs thoughts, concerns, and sources of stress.\
> Ability to alert parents to distressing topics, and suggest questions to help their child talk about difficult topics with parents.

Mindrest Teen	For ages 12–18. Focused on emotional awareness, identity, and school stress.

Mindrest Core	Ages 18+. Full experience with journaling, mental insights, and deeper reflection.
> Ability to optionally share conversations and reflections with professionals. (Planned)\

Mindrest Pro	For adults seeking deeper introspection, life planning, and habit support.
> (Features still under consideration)

## Each version uses age-appropriate language, design, and AI behavior to foster comfort, safety, and growth.
> ⚖️ Privacy & ethics are prioritized. Especially for minors. All data remains private and local unless explicitly shared.

# 🧑‍👧‍👦 Parental Controls & Moderation (For Junior & Teen Versions)
Mindrest takes youth safety seriously. For users under 18, especially in Mindrest Junior and Teen, we aim to implement a respectful balance between privacy and support through thoughtful moderation layers.

## 🔐 Built-In Guardrails for All Youth Versions:
- AI is softly restricted in tone and scope to avoid overwhelming or inappropriate dialogue
- Prompts and suggestions are developed using publicly available resources on emotional health, child development, and cognitive science.
- All moderation systems are local-first and privacy-conscious by default

### 🧸 Mindrest Junior (Ages 6–11)
- 🖥️ Parent Dashboard (Optional)
  - Parents/guardians can opt into a weekly summary view showing:
    
    > General themes in journaling (e.g. school, friends, stress)\
    > Signs of distress or recurring negative emotions\
    > Suggested conversation starters tailored to the child’s entries
- 🚨 Distress Detection Alerts:
  - On-device AI models detect language related to sadness, anxiety, or harm.
  - If triggered, a private alert is sent to the guardian only — no external systems, no cloud uploads, and no third-party data access.

- 🛡️Permission-Locked Settings
  - Critical features (like export, delete, or AI personality changes) require guardian confirmation.
  
### 🧭 Mindrest Teen (Ages 12–18)
- Autonomy-Focused Support
  Teens have more control over their experience, but can optionally:
  
  - Share selected reflections with a trusted adult or counselor
  - Enable soft nudges when entries show signs of emotional overload

- Wellness Check Mode (Experimental)
  An opt-in AI assistant designed to ask “How can I help?” when the user expresses high distress.
- 🧷 No Secret Monitoring
  - Teens are clearly informed of any active support features. Nothing is hidden or automatic. Trust and openness are core design pillars.

> 🧠 Mindrest is not a replacement for therapy or crisis services — and it never will be. But it can help you get more in touch with yourself.

## 🚫 No Ads, No Tracking, Ever.
We are committed to an ad-free, tracking-free environment for all users.

>This is meant to be a technology-empowered safe-space, and not somewhere where you have to constantly look over your shoulder, and wonder where your data is going.
